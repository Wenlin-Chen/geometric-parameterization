This is the Official TensorFlow 2 Implementation of `Geometric Parameterization`, proposed in the paper *ReLU Characteristic Activation Analysis*. Please read [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15912) for detailed descriptions of the proposed geometric parameterization.

All scripts and notebooks have been tested with `python==3.8.12` and `tensorflow==2.8.0`.
